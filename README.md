# doosan-python
This is a Python class that provides a wrapper around the C++ API for the Doosan robotic arm. It allows users to control the arm using Python code.

Doosan-Python, the python control scheme for Doosan robots, currently offers two modes: *terminal mode* and *trajectory replay mode*. It also supports *two* forms of movement: *joint* angle-based and *end effector* pose-based. Real-time information such as *joint angles*, *end effector pose*, and *joint torques* can be obtained and displayed on the terminal or logged. The system also supports external devices such as grippers.

Doosan-Python Class provides various methods, including `MoveJoint` for joint angle-based movement via terminal input, `MoveLine` for end effector pose-based linear movement via terminal input, and ReplayTrajectory for offline script-based movement using either joint angles or end effector pose. Other methods include `ReadJoint` for outputting the current angle values of the six joints, `ReadEndEffector` for outputting the three-dimensional position and orientation of the end effector, and `ReadJointTorque` for outputting the torque of each joint. `GripperControl` is used to control external gripper devices.

Other methods include `Wait` for delay, `Legacy` for cross-language (C++ -> Python) compatibility, `Home` for offline script-based return to the starting position using joint angles, `Initialize` for initialization, `QuitLoop` for terminating the loop via terminal input, `Disconnect` for disconnecting from the robot, and `Log` for logging.

Additionally, there are methods for variable conversion between ctypes data types and Python data types (`__ctypes_encode` and `__ctypes_decode`) and variable declaration (`__Variable_declaration`). Finally, `Read_plot_torques` is used to track torque changes and record and plot them.
